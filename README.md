## FAQ

#### Why not use https://straw.page/ or something similar?

I am stubborn and annoying.

#### Does the website need to be ugly?

Probably not but I can barely figure out tables you're asking too much of me.

#### Do you feel like your attempts to step away from the modern corporate internet are in vain because deep down you know that the masses will continue using closed sourced tools and you'll be stuck using them in some capacity forever no matter what you try to do to take back any amount of control in your own life?

what

#### How frequent are updates?

I work on this during my lunch break at work SOMETIMES don't hold your breath.
